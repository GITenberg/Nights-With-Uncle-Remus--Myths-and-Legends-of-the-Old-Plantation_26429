description: For more than a hundred years, the tales of Joel Chandler Harris have
  entertained and influenced both readers and writers. <i>Nights with Uncle Remus</i>
  gathers seventy-one of Harris's most popular narratives, featuring African American
  trickster tales, etiological myths, Sea Island legends, and chilling ghost stories.
  Told through the distinct voices of four slave storytellers, indispensable tales
  like "The Moon in the Mill-Pond" and other Brer Rabbit stories have inspired writers
  from Mark Twain to William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston to Toni Morrison, and helped
  revolutionize modern children's literature and folktale collecting.
